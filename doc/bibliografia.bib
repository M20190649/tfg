abstract={Vehicle detection and speed measurements are crucial tasks in traffic monitoring systems. In this work, we focus on several types of electronic sensors, operating on different physical principles in order to compare their effectiveness in real traffic conditions. Commercial solutions are based on road tubes, microwave sensors, LiDARs, and video cameras. Distributed traffic monitoring systems require a high number of monitoring stations. In order to improve the accuracy of traffic monitoring, several modalities, complementing each other, may be used in the monitoring stations. In this paper, we propose a multimodal approach to traffic monitoring, using sensors and signal processing algorithms developed specifically for the described task. The aim of the work described here is to test each modality in a real-life scenario, assess their accuracy and to evaluate their usefulness for multimodal traffic monitoring stations. The modalities described in the paper are: Doppler sensor with custom signal processing, video analysis based on cameras and neural networks (employing deep learning algorithms), audio monitoring based on an acoustic vector sensor developed by the authors, as well as LiDAR and Bluetooth as supplementary means of traffic monitoring. Additionally, road tubes and a commercial video-based monitoring system were used in order to provide reference data. Consequently, we can present in this paper a comparative study on the effectiveness of traffic sensors operating based on different principles of work.},

abstract = "Inappropriate cruising speed, such as speeding, is one of the major contributors to the road safety, which increases both the quantitative number and severity of traffic accidents. Previous studies have indicated that traffic congestion is one of the primary causes of drivers’ frustration and aggression, which may lead to inappropriate speed choice. In this study, the large taxi floating car data (FCD) was used to empirically evaluate how traffic congestion-related negative moods, defined as state aggressiveness, affected drivers’ speed choice. The indirect effect of traffic delay on the cruising speed adjustment through the state aggressiveness was assessed through the mediation analysis. Furthermore, the moderated mediation analysis was performed to explore the effect of driver type, value of time, and working duration on the mediation role of state aggressiveness. The results proved that the state aggressiveness was the mediator of the relationship between travel delays and driving speed adjustment, and the mediation role was different across various driver types. As compared to the aggressive drivers, the normal drivers and the steady drivers tended to behave more aggressively after experiencing non-recurrent congestion during the early stage of the trips. When the value of time was high, steady drivers were more likely to adjust their speed choice although the effect was not statistically significant for other driver types. The validation results indicated that the speed model incorporating state aggressiveness could better predict the travel time than the traditional speed model that only considering the specific expected speed distribution. The prediction results for the manifest indicators of state aggressiveness, such as the maximum speed and the speed deviation, also demonstrated a reasonable reflection of the field data."

abstract = "This paper compares speed data measured by induction loops of stationary detectors with reported speeds from floating-car data, which are based on most recent GPS observations of probe vehicles. Detector data are aggregated over a one minute time interval and that means a 30 s delay occurs on average. The time delay issues with respect to floating-car data are quite convoluted with many influences: (i) the update frequencies from vehicles to the backend server, (ii) the fleet size of floating cars, (iii) the current traffic flow, and (iv) the provider treatment. The floating-car dataset has a high spatial resolution with an average segment length of 100 m suited for large-scale traffic observation and management. The spatial dimension of detector data can only be reconstructed ex-post from spotty positions (mean detector positions distance approx. 1.3 km). The paper analyzes which source is more advantageous in terms of detecting traffic jams, high temporal availability of detector data or detailed spatial resolution of floating-car data. An algorithm is presented to compute the jam detection duration, which means we are able to recognize which data source detects the jam earliest. The results demonstrate that there exist regions along certain road stretches where floating-car data clearly outperform stationary data. However, in regions where detectors are densely placed, stationary sensor data recognize a jam situation approx. 2 min earlier than floating-car based speed data. The datasets cover a period of 80 days in 2015 for both driving directions on the German autobahn A9 in the north of Munich."

However, the bottleneck of all of  these systems is the need of a comprehensive and reliable data.  For traffic data acquisition, two sources are available today:  infrastructure sensors and floating vehicles. The first ones  consist on a set of static underground sensors installed in the  roads; the second ones consist of the use of intelligent vehicles  as mobile sensors. Both of them make use of different  communication systems, V2V, V2I and I2I. In this paper we  present a comparison of the performance of both kinds of  traffic data source for road traffic speed estimation. A set of  real experiments has been performed in several traffic  conditions, using infrastructure sensors and the information  retrieved by one instrumented intelligent vehicle. After  processing these data, the results show the better accuracy of  the floating cat data as well as its low cost in the case of a  massive implantation.}

abstract={The traffic flow measurement is one of the most important components in the traffic management systems. The existing traditional measurement methods are highly time-consuming and costly to continuously gather the required data, such as loop detectors and video cameras. However the travel duration provided by the emerging Floating Car Data (FCD) on Google Maps offers a novel way to estimate traffic flows. Therefore, this work presents a novel multi-model for urban traffic flows by applying a Gaussian Process Regressor (GPR) tuned using machine learning method based on FCD. The FCD on roads, requested through the Google Maps API, only provides information as congestion and travel duration. Traffic flows is estimated with GPR, including different models built by aggregating together data from days sharing similar configuration. The aggregation is performed manually or using unsupervised classification. At last, a series of experiments are conducted to compare the estimated traffic flow and the real one from actual sensors data. The obtained results show that, the proposed modeling can always reproduce and capture the tendency of real traffic flow. The aggregation permits effectively to increase the performance and to conclude on the capability of the approach to replace traditional loop detectors for the measurement of traffic flows.},

As these events are temporary and even seasonal in nature, concerned agencies need to identify cost-effective traffic management strategies to control this increased traffic. The current research empirically investigated the traffic flow, traffic volumes, and traffic management strategies for sporting events in Fort Myers, Florida. Extensive data were collected for over five consecutive years on an arterial road. These data contained traffic volumes from available loop detectors and travel time from Bluetooth sensors. Results showed that, like the experience curve effect, manual traffic control seemed to improve the traffic after the first year but leveled off thereafter. Signal retiming was effective for traffic entering games but not after games. The average travel time on a certain road segment for through traffic before the event starts was reduced by >40\% after the signal retiming. Variable message signs (VMS), while appeared to help traffic management, might not considerably improve travel time before and after the events on the road investigated. Although an alternative route was introduced for through traffic, most of drivers still used the arterial road even during peak congestion. With an average penetration rate of >4\%, this long-term study confirmed that the use of Bluetooth-based systems in collecting traffic probe data are still feasible in the near future. This current study contributes to the traffic management body of knowledge by empirically investigating the traffic management plans used for sporting events with objective and quantitative data in a five-year period."

While such measures are important to provide insights into the functional patterns of a city, novel quantitative methods, derived from ubiquitous mobile connectivity, are needed to provide policy-makers with better insights to improve urban management and planning decisions. In this paper, we develop a model that uses large-scale WiFi probe request data to model urban mobility trajectories in dense urban environments. We collect probe request data from a public Wifi network with 54 access points in the Lower Manhattan section of New York City over one week, accounting for more than 30 million observations and over 800,000 unique devices. First, we aggregate unique entries per access point and per hour, demonstrating the potential to use WiFi data to approximate local population counts by type of user. We then use a spatial network analysis to identify edge frequencies and directions of journeys between the network nodes, and apply the results to the road and pedestrian sidewalk network to identify usage intensity levels and trajectories for individual street segments. We demonstrate the significant potential in the use of WiFi probe request data for understanding mobility patterns in cities, while highlighting non-trivial issues in data privacy raised by the growing availability of public WiFi networks."

Current planning practices rely foremost on manual observations or coarse unverified assumptions and therefore do not properly scale or provide realistic data to inform facility planning. In this paper, we propose analysis methods to extract knowledge from large sets of network collected WiFi traces to better inform facility management and planning in large building complexes. The analysis methods, which build on a rich set of temporal and spatial features, include methods for quantification of area densities, as well as flows between specified locations, buildings or departments, classified according to the feature set. Spatio-temporal visualization tools built on top of these methods enable planners to inspect and explore extracted information to inform facility-planning activities. To evaluate the proposed methods and visualization tools, we present facility utilization analysis results for a large hospital complex covering more than 10 hectares. The evaluation is based on WiFi traces collected in the hospital’s WiFi infrastructure over two weeks observing around 18000 different devices recording more than a billion individual WiFi measurements. We highlight the tools’ ability to deduce people’s presences and movements and how they can provide respective insights into the test-bed hospital by investigating utilization patterns globally as well as selectively, e.g. for different user roles, daytimes, spatial granularities or focus areas."
